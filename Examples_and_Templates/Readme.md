### Documentation

*Documentation_Function_Uses_and_Examples.ipynb* contains a list of all functions developed for MSXPY, including function inputs/outputs, and usage examples. 

### Getting Started - Examples
*Example1_Run_Model_Example.ipynb* contains an initial example demonstrating importing an epanet model and msx file, executing a model simulation, and extracting model results
<br>
<br>
*Example2_Parallel.py* contains an example showing how to use python's multiprocessing module. This example does not utilize epanet models, but the multiprocessing framework is implemented in subsequent scripts which require model evaluations.
